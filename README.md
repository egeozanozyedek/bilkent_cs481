# Bilkent EEE 443 Neural Networks Mini-Projects

This repository consists of four homework assignments for the course EEE481 - Bioinformatics Algorithms offered in Bilkent University. The implemented algorithms are mentioned below, and each homework has its own readme file for more information.

### Homeworks

 [**HW1**](HW1/README.txt): Three string matching algorithms; Brute Force, Knuth Morris Pratt and Boyer Moore.
 
 [**HW2**](HW2/README.txt): Implementation of the Aho Corasick string matching algorithm.
 
 [**HW3**](HW3/README.txt): Multiple sequence alignment implementation for sequence to profile alignment.
 
 [**HW4**](HW4/README.txt): A BLAST-Like algorithm for efficient gene alignment.
